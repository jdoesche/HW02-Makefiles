Firstly, as per the instructions, I downloaded both the .cpp and .h files for the Employee, Officer, and Supervisor things.
Secondly, this README File and the makefile are both my own, made from scratch

Thirdly, I have no idea what else to put in this file. I have no idea what READMEs are actually used for.
